# Tasks

This repository was made as my solution to the exercise proposed in the 35th section of  
the [App Development Using Kotlin](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-desenvolvedor-kotlin/)  
course - *Desenvolvimento de Aplicativos Android Usando Kotlin*, in portuguese. The way I have  
approached the development of this app is simple: first I've tried to code the app as close as  
possible to the result intended by the teacher. Then, I'll check the section to see how the teacher  
tackled the development of this app. This is the third exercise from this course that I have pushed  
to GitHub.
